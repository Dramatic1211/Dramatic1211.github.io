# Dramile Cheng's Personal Website

A clean, minimalist, and tech-inspired personal website to share who I am, what I build, and what I think.

Inspired by brittanychiang.com but fully customized and built from scratch with pure HTML & CSS.

## Customization Tips

### Update the hero photo
1. Replace `assets/images/profile-id.svg` with your own image (keep a 3:4 aspect ratio for best results).
2. Update the `<img>` tag in `index.html` if you use a different file name or path.

### Tailor the hero spotlights
- Edit the four `.hero-spotlight` cards in `index.html` to reflect your current focus areas.
- Adjust related styling in `style.css` if you want different colors or spacing.

## Future Improvements

| Task | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
|Projects detail pages | High | Each project should have a dedicated detail page |
|Global CSS variables | Medium | For colors, fonts, spacing |
|Blog content automation | Medium | Consider Markdown management in the future |
|Responsive Navigation | Low | Mobile hamburger menu for nav links |
|Hover animation polish | Low | Consistent, subtle animations site-wide |
